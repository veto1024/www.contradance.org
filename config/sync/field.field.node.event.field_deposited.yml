description: 'Amount (cash and checks) removed from cashbox for deposit. Note: If no one is physically removing the money from the cashbox tonight or the money is not being physically separated from the rest of the cashbox money (e.g., placing it in a separate zip-lock bag), do not enter it as deposited. Checks are assumed to be deposited, as they cannot be used in later events as cash.'
